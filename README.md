# 🛡️ ARP Spoofing Simulation (MITM Attack)

This simulation demonstrates an ARP Spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle) attack using Ubuntu and Wireshark. It helps understand how attackers intercept and manipulate traffic within a local network, highlighting vulnerabilities and packet-level threats.

## 🧩 Features

- ARP spoofing using command-line tools
- Packet sniffing with Wireshark
- SSH session hijack observation
- Traffic analysis for compromised communication

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Ubuntu/Linux
- Wireshark
- Terminal Commands (arp, ifconfig, etc.)
  
## 🎯 Purpose

To understand real-world local network attacks and gain hands-on experience in threat detection and traffic analysis using open-source tools.

## 📂 Files Included

- `ARP_Spoofing_Report.pdf` – Summary of attack process and findings
